● Now let me add duplicate prevention logic to ensure we don't have duplicate dashers (by email):

● Update(enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx with 14 additions

● Good! Now let me update the todo list and verify that the implementation has all the requested features working properly:

● Let me check the drag-and-drop implementation to ensure it's properly set up:

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good! The drag-and-drop handlers are properly implemented. Now let me verify the data persistence:

● Search(pattern: "dasherCategories.*localStorage|localStorage.*dashers", path: "enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me check how the dashers are saved to localStorage:

● Search(pattern: "saveToLocalStorage.*dasher|dashBashState.*dasher", path: "enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me look for how the state is persisted:

● Search(pattern: "localStorage.setItem.*dashBashState|saveToLocalStorage", path: "enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the loading of dashers from localStorage:

  ⎿  Found 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The data persistence is properly integrated. Let me update the todo list to track what I've verified:

● Now let me verify the timer implementation and color coding:

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(enhanced-calculator-addressbook.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The timer implementation looks correct:
  - Red (text-red-400) for default < 24 hours remaining
  - Orange (text-orange-400) for the last hour (≤ 1 hour)
  - Green (text-green-400) for > 24 hours elapsed

  Let me now complete the testing verification:
